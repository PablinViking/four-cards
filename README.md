## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow




### What I learned

I keep learning how to arrange my elements in an orderly way and how to use Flexbox and Grid. 
This is the second challenge I did some time ago, and now I can see I didn’t use the column layout in Grid the best way.
